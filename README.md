About it
=====================
I've created this project to make public the AngularJS directives filters and directives, called components in the rest of this document, that I've built and use for some projects and they can be used for general purpose.

## Status
This project is under construction!!!

I've refactored and documented some of the AngularJS components that I built for some professional or non-pofessional (for fun :D) to deliver it under this project to be useful for general purpose and know for what are useful and how to use them, however I'm working in it in my spare time but I am also doing another stuff in that time, including another profit and non-profit projects, so the project doesn't have all the components that I hope, so far.
