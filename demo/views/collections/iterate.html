<h3>When may ifc-repeat directive be useful?</h3>
<p>When you have a collection (array) of values/object which your would like to remove
   elements that you can identify by a key, but you want to avoid to walk the collection each
   time to look for the element to remove (checking the keys), but at the same time you need
   the collection to keep the order so using a simple hash (keys ==> value object) doesn't fit
   to it</p>
<hr>
<button data-ng-click="initUsers()">Initialise users list</button>
<label>To remove a element of the next tables just type the number of
		      the id column an press <input type="text" size="1" data-ng-model="keyOfElemToRemove">
			<button data-ng-click="removeElement()">remove</button>
		</label>
<div data-ng-switch="elementRemoved">
	<span data-ng-switch-when="removed" style="color: blue;">
		Element with id: {{keyOfElemToRemove}}, has been removed
	</span>
	<span data-ng-switch-when="failed" style="color: red;">
		Non-exist any element with id {{keyOfElemToRemove}}
	</span>
	<span data-ng-switch-default></span>
</div>

<h4>Next table was generated using ifc-repeat</h4>
<p>elements are set to null rather than delete, so if your use cases require delete a random
   element you can do that using a hash to know the position in the array, but avoiding to
   rebuild the hash each time that you would like to remove one, because setting it a null you
   are keeping the same position of the elements as it doesn't happen when elements are removed</p>
<table>
	<thead>
	<tr>
		<td>key</td>
		<td>Name</td>
		<td>Points</td>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr data-ifc-repeat="user in usersListIfcRepeat">
		<td>{{user.id}}</td>
		<td>{{user.name}}</td>
		<td>{{user.points}}</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h4>And the following one using ng-repeat</h4>
<p>using ng-repeat you cannot apply the same technique as ifc-repeat for two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
	<li>ng-repeat iterate over null values as usual, so those elements fall out in an
	    iteration like another else element so you should manage them usign another directive
	    like ng-show
	</li>
	<li>ng-repeat doesn't allow to add two times the same object (reference equality),
	    so setting null more than one element you would get an error
	</li>
</ol>

	<tr>

		<td>{{user.name}}</td>
		<td>{{user.points}}</td>
