<h3>When may ifc-repeat directive be useful?</h3>
<p>When you have a collection (array) of values/object which your would like to remove
   elements that you can identify by a key, but you want to avoid to walk the collection each
   time to look for the element to remove (checking the keys), but at the same time you need
   the collection to keep the order so using an only hash (keys ==> value object) doesn't fit
   to it.
</p>
<p>
e.g. You have a real time application which show a message stream and the owner of the message can
delete his own messages, so when he delete one the application sends a notification (i.e. a web
sockets messages with the message's id/key) to all other connected users to delete the specified
message; then if the application use a hash to associate the id/key of the message with its
position in the list (array), it can tackle to delete the specified message without walking the
array to find it.

<hr>
<button class="pure-button" data-ng-click="initUsers()">Initialise users list</button>
<label for="numKeyToDel">To remove a element of the next tables just type the number of
       the id column an press <input type="text" size="1" id="numKeyToDel"
                                     data-ng-model="keyOfElemToRemove">
	<button class="pure-button pure-button-primary" data-ng-click="removeElement()">remove</button>
</label>
<div data-ng-switch="elementRemoved">
	<span data-ng-switch-when="removed" style="color: blue;">
		Element with key: {{keyOfElemToRemove}}, has been removed
	</span>
	<span data-ng-switch-when="failed" style="color: red;">
		Non-exist any element with key {{keyOfElemToRemove}}
	</span>
	<span data-ng-switch-default></span>
</div>

<h4>Next table was generated using ifc-repeat</h4>
<p>elements are set to null rather than delete, so if your use cases require delete a random
   element you can do that using a hash to know the position in the array, but avoiding to
   rebuild the hash each time that you would like to remove one, because setting it a null the
   application keeps the same position of the elements because the value of the position is
   replace by null, so ifc-repeat will ignore it.</p>
<table>
	<thead>
	<tr>
		<td>key</td>
		<td>Name</td>
		<td>Points</td>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr data-ifc-repeat="user in usersListIfcRepeat">
		<td>{{user.id}}</td>
		<td>{{user.name}}</td>
		<td>{{user.points}}</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h4>And the following one using ng-repeat</h4>
<p>using ng-repeat you cannot apply the same technique as ifc-repeat for two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
	<li>ng-repeat iterate over null values as usual, so those elements fall out in an
	    iteration like another else element so you should manage them usign another directive
	    like ng-show
	</li>
	<li>ng-repeat doesn't allow to add two times the same object (reference equality),
	    so setting null more than one element you would get an error
	</li>
</ol>

	<thead>
	<tr>
		<td>Name</td>

	</tr>

	<tbody>
	<tr data-ng-repeat="user in usersListNgRepeat">

		<td>{{user.name}}</td>
		<td>{{user.points}}</td>
